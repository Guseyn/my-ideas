## My quotes (any coincidences are just coincidences)

1. Any story can be dramatic. Just turn on dramatic music.

## Apps

1. Something that hepls read artciles from the web
2. Cute web site (+mobile app) where user can find chords(and music sheets) for songs for different instruments, also user can add chords, info about song/album. Kina wiki for musicians + chords, maybe deep analysis of songs.
3. App for splitting mp3 files into layers and combine them in custom order and musical arrangement, probably I'd need some sort of AI.
